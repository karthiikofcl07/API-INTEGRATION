The Weather Checker Website is a simple and professional web-based tool that allows users to check real-time weather information for any country or city. Users can type the name of a country or city into the search box, and the app fetches and displays current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition with a matching icon. This Website uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve up-to-date weather data in metric units. The user interface is clean, responsive, and visually appealing, designed using HTML and CSS with a focus on simplicity and usability. The search button features a modern design with hover animations, and the layout adapts well across various screen sizes.
